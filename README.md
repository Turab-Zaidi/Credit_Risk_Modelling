### Credit_Risk_Modelling

Data Import and Cleaning: Imported necessary libraries and datasets, followed by comprehensive data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.

Hypothesis Testing: Conducted rigorous hypothesis testing using Chi-Square, ANOVA, and VIF tests to identify significant predictors and address multicollinearity, emphasizing this critical analytical phase.

Data Preprocessing: Prepared the data through normalization and feature engineering to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

Model Selection: Evaluated various models and determined that XGBoost provided the best performance for predicting credit risk.

Model Validation: Conducted proper hypothesis testing and validation to confirm the model's accuracy and reliability in credit risk assessment.
