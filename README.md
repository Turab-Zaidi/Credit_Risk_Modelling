### Credit_Risk_Modelling
This project aims to develop a credit risk modeling system using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system processes historical credit data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocesses the data, applies various machine learning models, and finally implements a deep learning artificial neural network (ANN) model for credit risk prediction.
